# albom.dll

A library of routines for Kharkiv (Ukraine) incoherent scatter radar data processing. It is used in [UPRISE](https://github.com/Albom/UPRISE) (Unified Processing of the Results of Incoherent Scatter Experiments) package.

*Albom.dll* consists of more than 100 functions that can be divided into several groups:
 - functions for manipulating the initial data;
 - functions for calculating altitude of the scattered volume;
 - functions for working with files in the specified directory in the disk file system;
 - functions for output data manipulating;
 - time and date functions;
 - functions for calculating IS signalsâ€™ spectra and ACFs;
 - functions for data processing:
     - arrays manipulation;
     - statistical routines;
     - linear and spline interpolation, polynomial approximation;
     - generating random real numbers with uniform and normal distributions;
     - Fourier transform.
